# Updates: Creathon for Solana
- Solana integrated: magipop Creathon aims to leverage Solana’s high scalability, automation, and cost-efficiency. Drawing on Solana’s fully community-driven autonomous Web3 infrastructure and compatibility with the EVM system, we aspire to enhancing both the MagiPop and Solana ecosystems
- Creathon Module Launched.
- ZRC-20 integrated: Utilized ZetaChain's solution which supports BTC staking and voting. This allows the initiator of a creative project to kickstart collaborative creativity through BTC staking, and permits other administrators to participate in governance by staking BTC to vote.
- Integrated the EVM mechanism and ZK technology to ensure copyright ownership and originality verification of the collaborative projects, which also guarantees fairness.

# Vision
Al fused co-creation tool for community, forging large-scale creativity into evolving stories
# Description
In large-scale creative collaborations, it often becomes confusing, like those cluttered group chats, forums, posts
We want to find a way to aggregate large-scale ideas, but at the same time keep it structured, so that everyone who wants to participate can quickly get the big picture and the details needed to move forward on the same consensus.
Creathon is a platform where fans can collaboratively work on and showcase narrative projects on topics they're passionate about.
magipop Creathon hopes to leverage Ethereum’s excellent seamless EVM scalability, secure Web3 infrastructure and rich ecosystem. Elevate the creative creator experience in magipop and the Ethereum ecosystem, driving a win-win situation of innovation and collaborative scale growth.
# Innovations
## Co-creation Event: ZK Privacy
This contract is the cornerstone of our pioneering privacy system. With the assurance of zk-SNARK and autonomous Web3 infrastructure, users on Creathon can experience end-to-end privacy protection.
- Proof of Creation: Using zk technology, users can submit their creations and affirm their validity without revealing any content.
- Inspiration Proof: Harnessing zk-SNARK and Magiry.AI, users can verify the uniqueness of their inspirations without disclosing specific content. Concurrently, they can publicize their inspirations to motivate others.
- Double-blind Voting: Leveraging zk's one-way function, users can confirm the authenticity of their votes without exposing their actions.
We trust that while zk is the foundation of privacy, it also serves as a vital bridge to consensus.

## Magiry.AI: Idea tracking by LLM
What truly distinguishes us is Magiry.AI, our creative assistant. Through the "detail_of" method, Magiry.AI seamlessly integrates diverse ideas from various creators, presenting them in a structured map. This approach makes collaborative creation feel like piecing together a story using LEGO. The Creathon map offers a unique space for creators to collaborate on fan-fiction storylines, all under a shared worldview. As a user contributes an idea, our AI analyzes it and positions it on the map, connecting it with other related ideas from different creators.
meanwhile, Our "Creathon" turns this collaborative process into a playful competition. Here, creators engage in exciting challenges, and their creations are showcased on a map, highlighting the interconnections. This layout allows for an easy overview while also providing detailed insights when needed.
## magipop Map: Data Chain
The magipop Map Contract lies at the core of Creathon's unique creative-linking system. By seamlessly integrating the capabilities of blockchain, AI, and collective creativity, we initiate our system with a distinctive contract hash. This sets a secure and transparent foundation for all operations. Capitalizing on the efficiency of layer 2, we ensure that all crucial data is securely stored on-chain, thus safeguarding every creator's contributions. Moreover, the contract serves as a bridge, connecting creators with their innovative concepts. With built-in functions like "post" and "detail_of", creators have the flexibility to share their ideas and retrieve them when needed. This design promotes a lively environment where ideas flow naturally and collaborations emerge effortlessly.
