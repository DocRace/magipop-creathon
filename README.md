# Updates: magipop Forge for Neo EVM-compatible Chain
We could not have established such a thriving and collaborative creator community without the indispensable benefits brought by EVM Side-chain on the Neo blockchain. Key ways that EVM Side-chain empower our Forge:

1. **Significantly enhance efficiency with Neo's EVM-compatible sidechain** - By executing smart contracts written for Ethereum without changes, the sidechain reduces transaction complexity, facilitating seamless collaborative creation within our diverse community.
2. **Enhance security** - The sidechain's structure designed to counter MEV attacks, such as frontrunning, enhances the trading experience and makes the system more resilient to potential attacks.
3. **Enhance asset liquidity in mass content co-creation scenarios** - much easier for creators with multiple low-value NFTs to engage in decentralized finance and trading within our community.
4. **Simplify management** - The interoperability of Neo's sidechain with other networks reduces operational complexity, as community members don't have to manage interactions with each individual network separately.
5. **Improved scalability** - The sidechain's compatibility with Ethereum's smart contracts makes it more developer-friendly, allowing for large-scale automated generation of contracts representing our collective works.

## **Synergy & Contribution** to Neo
1. Neo lacks projects in **the Passion Economy and creator economy spaces**, so magipop can **fill this gap** and provide unique value.
2. magipop will **bring diverse types of creators into the Neo ecosystem**, expanding and enriching the creator community.
3. Through **positive externality Tokenomic designs**, both internally and externally, magipop will enable creators, not just speculators, to earn real income and **move beyond the Ponzi model**. This aligns with Neo’s goal of building real utility and value.
4. magipop Creathon will fully utilize Neo’s **high performance, scalibility and** **AI capabilities** to seamlessly integrate our AI models, enabling smooth idea scoring and evaluation for collaborative creativity.
5. By focusing on niche passion communities, magipop will bring in **dedicated user bases that are deeply invested and engaged**, further increasing activity and transactions on Neo.
6. magipop's gamified and transparent approach will **showcase the strengths of blockchain for new user segments**, acting as an onboarding portal for mainstream consumers to experience the benefits of Neo firsthand.
7. As an innovative model for community-driven co-creation and crowdsourced storytelling, magipop will highlight new use cases that demonstrate Neo’s versatility and ability to support next-gen applications.

# Vision
Al fused co-creation tool for community, forging large-scale creativity into evolving stories.
# Description
In large-scale creative collaborations, it often becomes confusing, like those cluttered group chats, forums, posts
We want to find a way to aggregate large-scale ideas, but at the same time keep it structured, so that everyone who wants to participate can quickly get the big picture and the details needed to move forward on the same consensus.
Creathon is a platform where fans can collaboratively work on and showcase narrative projects on topics they're passionate about.
magipop Creathon hopes to leverage Ethereum’s excellent seamless EVM scalability, secure Web3 infrastructure and rich ecosystem. Elevate the creative creator experience in magipop and the Ethereum ecosystem, driving a win-win situation of innovation and collaborative scale growth.
# Innovations
## Co-creation Event: ZK Privacy
This contract is the cornerstone of our pioneering privacy system. With the assurance of zk-SNARK and autonomous Web3 infrastructure, users on Creathon can experience end-to-end privacy protection.
- Proof of Creation: Using zk technology, users can submit their creations and affirm their validity without revealing any content.
- Inspiration Proof: Harnessing zk-SNARK and Magiry.AI, users can verify the uniqueness of their inspirations without disclosing specific content. Concurrently, they can publicize their inspirations to motivate others.
- Double-blind Voting: Leveraging zk's one-way function, users can confirm the authenticity of their votes without exposing their actions.
We trust that while zk is the foundation of privacy, it also serves as a vital bridge to consensus.
## Copyright market: autonomous Network
magipop Creathon hopes to leverage Ethereum’s excellent seamless EVM scalability, secure Web3 infrastructure and rich ecosystem. Elevate the creative creator experience in magipop and the Ethereum ecosystem, driving a win-win situation of innovation and collaborative scale growth.
## Idea tracking by LLM
What truly distinguishes us is our creative AI assistant. Through the "detail_of" method, Creathon app seamlessly integrates diverse ideas from various creators, presenting them in a structured map. This approach makes collaborative creation feel like piecing together a story using LEGO. The Creathon map offers a unique space for creators to collaborate on fan-fiction storylines, all under a shared worldview. As a user contributes an idea, our AI analyzes it and positions it on the map, connecting it with other related ideas from different creators.
meanwhile, Our "Creathon" turns this collaborative process into a playful competition. Here, creators engage in exciting challenges, and their creations are showcased on a map, highlighting the interconnections. This layout allows for an easy overview while also providing detailed insights when needed.

## magipop Data Chain
The magipop Map Contract lies at the core of Creathon's unique creative-linking system. By seamlessly integrating the capabilities of blockchain, AI, and collective creativity, we initiate our system with a distinctive contract hash. This sets a secure and transparent foundation for all operations. Capitalizing on the efficiency of layer 2, we ensure that all crucial data is securely stored on-chain, thus safeguarding every creator's contributions. Moreover, the contract serves as a bridge, connecting creators with their innovative concepts. With built-in functions like "post" and "detail_of", creators have the flexibility to share their ideas and retrieve them when needed. This design promotes a lively environment where ideas flow naturally and collaborations emerge effortlessly.
